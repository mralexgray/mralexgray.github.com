Add Application Tests Here. 

Store your application tests here. I prefer Karma/Jasmine, but obviously, you choose what suits your workflow

If you want to use the Karma/Jasmine testing suite, your first step would be to run the karma init method.

~ $ karma init

Additional details here: 

Installation: http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/intro/installation.html
Configuration: http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/intro/configuration.html

A good rule of thumb is to install the karma.conf.js file within the /tests directory and set the basePath to "../". 
From there, you can simply manage the files variable to the files and specs that you would like to include in tests.
